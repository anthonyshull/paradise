# PARADISE

> Wherever there is any hope of salvage, we will carefully investigate fruitful definitions and deductive methods. > We will nurse them, strengthen them, and make them useful.
> No one shall drive us out of the paradise which Cantor has created for us.
> - On the Infinite, David Hilbert
